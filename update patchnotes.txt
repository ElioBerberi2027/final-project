Done by Elio Berberi

Changes:
Added a new txt file titled necessery_Credots.txt:

Created background images using Photoshops AI
	much faster and non copyright, i will discuss this with Rosen tomorrow

Developed:

Future Suggestions:
	We keep the game simple
	Create a new home label each time u need to reuse the home scene:
		label home(#which variation ex. home(1),home(2)...)
			show officebk
			then continue story.
