Update 1.0
Done by Elio Berberi

Changes:
Added a new txt file titled necessery_Credots.txt:
	place any credits here

Created background images using Photoshops AI
	much faster and non copyright, i will discuss this with Rosen tomorrow

Developed:
	Created a new image defining system, explained how to define and used in code (read comments)
	Added more to story and a new event, event doesnt work as it needs 2 new labels
	Added a EndGame label wich should be called everytime the player loses the game
	Added more to first menu, now all three choices lead to something
	
Future Suggestions:
	We keep the game simple
	Create a new home label each time u need to reuse the home scene:
		label home(#which variation ex. home(1),home(2)...)
			show officebk
			then continue story.
