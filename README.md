Main challenges:

1: learning to use renpy's syntax.

2: finding the time to work together

3: trying to mesh Python with renpy, renpy does not natively support python

4: incorporating add-ons like pygame into renpy

5: learning how to use screens and labels in renpy

6: learning effective googling and experimentation

7: we spend two days learning renpy's case sensitive syntax, in renpy the jump statement has a slightly different meaning depending on if it is in or out of an action block. 

8: writing a story and thinking of unique mechanics.
