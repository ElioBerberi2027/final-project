main challenge-
One: learning to use renpy's syntacs.
Two: finding the time to work together
Three: trying to mesh python with renpy, renpy does not natively support python
Four incorporating add-ons like pygame into renpy
Five learning how to use screens and labels in renpy
Six: learning effective googling and experimentation
Seven: we spend two days learning renpy's case sensitive synacs, in renpy the jump statement has slightly different meaning depending on if it is in or out of an action block. 
Eight: writing a story and thinking of unique mechanics.
